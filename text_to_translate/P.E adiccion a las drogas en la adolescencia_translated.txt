Drug addiction in adolescence
According to the World Drug Report 2024 of the UNODC (Office of the
United Nations against drugs and crime), the number of people who consume
drugs increased to 292 million in 2022, representing a 20% increase
In the last 10 years.
Cannabis remains the most consumed drug in the world, with 228 million
users, followed by opioids (60 million).
Argentina is the second country with the greatest consumption of psychoactive drugs in the
Region, according to a report by the Argentine Catholic University (UCA).Age
Average consumption start between 17 and 21 years.
Psychoactive drugs: depressing (opioids), stimulating (cocaine), hallucinogenic (LSD),
dissociative (ketamine)
Opioids: pain prescribed medications, such as morphine, codeine and oxycodone, thus
as illegal drugs like heroin.
Influence and risk factors
1. Biological and psychological factors
● Mental health problems: anxiety, depression and behavioral disorders
They can increase consumption vulnerability.
● Search for sensations: some teenagers have a greater
Need for stimulating experiences, which leads them to try substances.
2. Environmental and family factors
● Dysfunctional environments: family conflicts, negligence or abuse
They can lead to escape through drugs.
● Lack of parental supervision: the absence of limits and support increases
Probability of experiencing with substances.
● Drug availability: easy access to home, school or
community facilitates its consumption.
3. Social and cultural factors
● Group pressure: the influence of friends they consume can make
Teenagers try drugs to fit.
● Normalization of consumption: If drug use is seen as common
Or glamorous in society, adolescents can consider it acceptable.
● Social stress: school problems, bullying or lack of opportunities
They can lead to the search for refuge in consumption.
Consequences
1. impact on health
Drug use during adolescence can seriously affect development
Cerebral, harming memory, learning and self -control.In addition, the abuse of
substances is related to cardiovascular problems, liver diseases and
Psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression.You can also increase risk
of overdose and infectious diseases in case of intravenous consumption.
2. Impact on personal economy
Addiction not only implies an economic cost in the purchase of substances, but also the
possibility of abandoning studies or employment, which reduces opportunities for
Professional and financial development.In the long term, this can lead to greater
dependency of the family or even to situations of poverty and marginality.
3. Social impact
Adolescents with addiction problems usually face isolation, conflicts
relatives and loss of important relationships.Addiction can lead to crime or
to participation in dangerous environments, affecting community coexistence and security.
In addition, social stigmatization hinders integration into society, reducing
Opportunities to receive support and rehabilitation.
Prevention
There are various prevention strategies to reduce addiction risks in
teenagers.Here I share some of the most effective:
1. Education and awareness
Informing young people about the negative effects of drugs and addiction is key.
Educational programs in schools and awareness campaigns can help
Adolescents understand the risks and make informed decisions.
2. Strengthening of emotional skills
Foster resilience, self -esteem and the ability to make healthy decisions helps
To adolescents to resist social pressure and handle stress without resorting to substances.
3. Family support and open communication
A stable family environment and effective communication between parents and children can reduce
The risk of consumption.Teenagers who feel heard and supported have
Less likely to resort to drugs.
5. Early intervention
Detect signs of consumption or emotional problems in time allows us to act before
That addiction develops.Community programs and psychological advice can
be fundamental in prevention
